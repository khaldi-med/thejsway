            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is a crucial process that involves the exchange of water between the atmosphere, land, and oceans.</p>

            <h2>Stages of the Water Cycle</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Evaporation</h3>
                <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. This stage is driven by the heat of the sun.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Condensation</h3>
                <p>Condensation occurs when water vapor cools and changes back into liquid droplets, forming clouds in the sky.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Precipitation</h3>
                <p>Precipitation happens when the water droplets in clouds become too heavy and fall to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Collection</h3>
                <p>During the collection stage, water gathers in bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it can eventually evaporate again, continuing the cycle.</p>

        <aside>
            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>The <mark>water cycle</mark> is powered by solar energy, and it plays a key role in regulating the Earth's climate!</p>
        </aside>

        <section id="importance">
            <h2>Importance of the Water Cycle</h2>
            <p>The water cycle is essential for replenishing freshwater supplies, supporting ecosystems, and maintaining weather patterns. Without it, life on Earth would not be sustainable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The water cycle is a continuous, dynamic process that sustains life on Earth by circulating water through the environment. Understanding its stages helps us appreciate the importance of water in our daily lives.</p>
