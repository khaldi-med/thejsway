* A variable is an information storage area.

* languages, like C or Java, require variable types to always be defined. This is called **static typing**.

* JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**, varibles type is deduced from the value stored in the variable and may change while the program rune.

* string called a **template literal** Inside a template literal, expressions are identified by the `${expression}` syntax. --> `${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`

* **Implicit conversions**, They happen automatically without the programmer's intervention.
* **Explicit conversion**, JavaScript has the `Number()` and `String()` commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.

#### Function-------

* A function is a group of statements that performs a particular task.

* A parameter is information that the function needs in order to work.

* A function body must be kept simple, or otherwise split into several sub-functions. As a rule of thumb, 30 lines of code should be a max for non-specific cases.

* Variables declared inside a function are limited in scope to the function body. They are called local variables.

*  For a particular call, supplied parameter values are called arguments.

#### Objects-------

* Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a way to write programs using objects. When using OOP, you write, create, and modify objects, and the objects make up your program.

* As stated earlier, a JavaScript object can be created by simply setting its properties within a pair of curly braces: {...}. Each property is a key/value pair. This is called an **object literal**.

* After creating an object, you can access the value of its properties using **dot notation** such as ``myObject.myProperty``.
