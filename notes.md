* A variable is an information storage area. 

* languages, like C or Java, require variable types to always be defined. This is called **static typing**.

* JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**, varibles type is deduced from the value stored in the variable and may change while the program rune.

* string called a **template literal** Inside a template literal, expressions are identified by the `${expression}` syntax. --> `${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`

* **Implicit conversions**, They happen automatically without the programmer's intervention.
* **Explicit conversion**, JavaScript has the `Number()` and `String()` commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.
